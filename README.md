🐼 All images used in this application are created by Linglin Chang.

🐼 GUI is created with Tkinter.

🐼 This application shows you a random English phrase from a database I collected, and when you press the “PANDA IT” button, it will show you the most accurate Chinese equivalent. Of course, if you press the “Learn more” button, another random English phrase will show up, and the “PANDA IT” key will again show you the Chinese translation.

🐼 If you are not fluent in Chinese and have no idea what those character means, simply click the “Copy Chinese” button to copy the Chinese phrase to your clipboard so you can Google it.
